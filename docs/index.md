Enterprise Data Warehouses (EDWs) play an increasingly important role on academic medical campuses, housing clinical and other enterprise-wide data and making it available for research and strategic purposes in the learning health system. Here, we will create an end-to-end training program that introduces clinician researchers to clinical database architecture and clinical coding standards, teaches them how to translate their research questions into queries that will allow them to extract data properly, and how to do so in a way that supports transparency and reproducibility while still respecting guidelines for proper data sharing. This work will build on longstanding partnerships with the leadership and data analysts of the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW). [1,2] We will work together to promote improved communication and collaboration between data analysts and clinical researchers to make them better partners in research projects. To promote reusability of research reports and database queries within Northwestern’s research community, we will provide workflows for preservation through our next-generation research data management (RDM) system to make these resources discoverable. Our ultimate goal is to bolster support for our local research community to use clinical research data from the NMEDW and also parlay this experience to develop a blueprint of best practice workflows for clinical research data education and training that could be applied in libraries at other institutions.
